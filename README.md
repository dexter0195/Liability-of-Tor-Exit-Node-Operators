# On the liability of Tor Exit Relay Operators
## Abstract
Tor is a network providing anonymous access to the Internet
to users all over the world. It relies on the efforts of volunteers who
share their personal internet access point with other users of the network.
This service is extremely valuable in countries where the censorship is
much stronger but it is sometime used for bad purposes. Many where the
abuses of the Tor network to commit cyber-crimes or to visit websites
hosting child pornography or drug selling platforms. The Tor Exit Relays
operators are the ones that put themselves in the higher risk of being
held accountable for committing such crimes because of the technological
architecture of Tor. The purpose of this paper is to investigate on the
problem of the legal liability of Tor Exit Relays operators in case of law
infringement. We will compare the role of these people with the figure
of the Internet Service Providers and we will see if the shields that ISP
benefit are still valid in the context of Tor. The paper seeks to answer
the research questions: 1) Are Tor Exit Relays operators ISPs? 2) Are
they liable for the actions of their users? 3) Are they forced to inspect
the traffic to inhibit their users to commit crimes?
